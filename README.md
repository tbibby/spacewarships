# spacewarships
A Swift command line program to query the Star Wars API at https://swapi.co

# Usage
Run this project in Xcode. After downloading starship data from the Star Wars API, the program will prompt you to input the number of mega lights. The program will output a list of starship names with the number of stops they need to make.

# TODO
- Program should cache API output so subsequent instances can read data locally
- Internet reachability check
- Handle other HTTP status codes (301, 404, etc.)

# Sample output
```
